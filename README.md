# Analysis:
- Input: the name, year, and gender they are interested in.

- Process: is to read the data files, which contain baby names ranked by frequency of use for each year
from 2001 to 2010, and store the information in arrays. The program prompts the user to input either ”1”
to check the name’s ranking in a specified year or ”2” to check the name’s ranking in all the years.
If the user chooses ”1”, the program prompts the user for the year, gender, and name they are interested in. It then searches the appropriate array for the name and gender in the given year and returns the
ranking of the name. If the name is not found, the program returns a message that the name was not found.
If the user chooses ”2”, the program loops through all the years and prints the ranking of the name for
each year in which it appears.

- Output: the ranking of the name for the given year and gender, or for all years in which it appears.
If the name is not found, the program returns a message indicating that the name was not found.
